          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Synthara AI was founded in 2025 with a simple mission: to create intelligent software agents that can understand user requirements and generate clean, efficient solutions with no visual noise or redundancy.</p>

          <p>Our journey began when we noticed a gap in the market for AI-powered tools that could generate not just functional code, but code that adheres to principles of clean design and visual harmony. We believed that by focusing on typography, spacing, and the elimination of unnecessary elements, we could create software agents that produce truly elegant solutions.</p>

          <p>Today, we're proud to be at the forefront of the intelligent agent revolution, creating tools that help developers, designers, and businesses build better software with less effort.</p>
