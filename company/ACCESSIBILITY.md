# Accessibility Guide for Synthara Golden Website

This document provides guidance on the accessibility features implemented in the Synthara Golden website and best practices for maintaining and enhancing accessibility in future development.

## Implemented Accessibility Features

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure

- **Skip Link**: A skip link is provided at the top of each page to allow keyboard users to bypass navigation and go directly to the main content.
- **ARIA Landmarks**: Proper ARIA landmark roles are used to define the structure of the page:
  - `role="banner"` for the header
  - `role="navigation"` for navigation menus
  - `role="main"` for the main content
  - `role="contentinfo"` for the footer
  - `role="complementary"` for supplementary content
- **Headings**: Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) is used for page structure, with each section having a properly labeled heading.
- **Section Labels**: `aria-labelledby` attributes are used to connect headings with their sections.

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

- **Focus Management**: All interactive elements are focusable and have visible focus indicators.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Arrow key navigation is implemented for dropdown menus.
- **Focus Trapping**: Modal dialogs trap focus to prevent keyboard users from tabbing outside the modal.
- **Escape Key**: The Escape key can be used to close dialogs and dropdowns.

### 3. Screen Reader Support

- **ARIA Attributes**: Proper ARIA attributes are used to enhance screen reader announcements:
  - `aria-expanded` for expandable elements
  - `aria-hidden` for elements that should be hidden from screen readers
  - `aria-live` for dynamic content
  - `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` for labeling elements
- **Form Labels**: All form controls have proper labels.
- **Error Messages**: Form validation errors are announced to screen readers.

### 4. Visual Design

- **Color Contrast**: Text colors have sufficient contrast with background colors.
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus indicators are provided for keyboard users.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes and zoom levels.
- **Reduced Motion**: Animations are disabled for users who prefer reduced motion.

### 5. JavaScript Enhancements

- **Progressive Enhancement**: The site works without JavaScript, but is enhanced with it.
- **Keyboard Event Handling**: JavaScript event handlers are provided for keyboard interactions.
- **Focus Management**: Focus is managed appropriately when content changes.

## Accessibility Testing

The website has been tested for accessibility using:

- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing
- Color contrast checking
- Code validation for ARIA attributes

## Maintaining Accessibility

When making changes to the website, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Preserve Semantic Structure**: Maintain the semantic HTML structure and ARIA attributes.
2. **Test Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard.
3. **Maintain Color Contrast**: Ensure text has sufficient contrast with its background.
4. **Test with Screen Readers**: Test changes with screen readers to ensure they are properly announced.
5. **Respect User Preferences**: Honor user preferences for reduced motion and other accessibility settings.
